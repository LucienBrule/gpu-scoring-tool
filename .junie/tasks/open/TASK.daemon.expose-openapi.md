## ðŸ§© Task: Expose OpenAPI Metadata for `glyphd`

Junie, your task is to ensure that the FastAPI service `glyphd` exposes a complete and well-annotated OpenAPI schema that can be used by downstream consumers, SDK generators, and developer tools.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Provide OpenAPI metadata and tags on all routes.
- Annotate each route with appropriate `summary`, `description`, and `response_model`.
- Define reusable response models for all endpoints using Pydantic v2.
- Make sure FastAPI's built-in `/docs` and `/openapi.json` routes are functional and reflect the current schema.

---

## ðŸ§© OpenAPI Metadata

In `main.py` or `app.py`, ensure the FastAPI app has:

```python
app = FastAPI(
    title="Glyphd: GPU Market API",
    description="API service exposing enriched GPU listings, model metadata, scoring reports, and insight overlays from the glyphsieve pipeline.",
    version="0.1.0",
    contact={
        "name": "Glyphsieve Research",
        "url": "https://github.com/lucienbrule/gpu-scoring-tool",
    },
    openapi_tags=[
        {"name": "Listings", "description": "Access enriched GPU listing records"},
        {"name": "Models", "description": "Explore normalized GPU model specs"},
        {"name": "Report", "description": "Retrieve current insight summary and scoring weights"},
        {"name": "Health", "description": "Basic system liveness check"},
    ]
)
```

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Add `tags=["Listings"]`, `tags=["Models"]`, etc. to each router.
- Define proper HTTP status codes (200, 404, etc.).
- Ensure that `/openapi.json` and `/docs` render cleanly with no schema warnings.

---

## ðŸ§ª Completion Criteria

- Navigating to `/docs` shows a human-usable API UI with model schemas.
- Navigating to `/openapi.json` returns the valid OpenAPI schema.
- Routes include tag groupings and descriptions.
- DTOs are referenced properly and not inlined as anonymous objects.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

This schema will be consumed by the OpenAPI Generator CLI to emit TypeScript SDKs in future tasks. Correct structure and tagging is essential.

Be meticulous hereâ€”this schema is your interface contract with the frontend.
