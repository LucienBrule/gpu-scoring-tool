## ðŸ§© Task: Define the API Surface for `glyphd`

Junie, your task is to define and scaffold the REST API interface for the `glyphd` FastAPI backend. This service will expose structured access to scored GPU data, GPU model metadata, and insights derived from the pipeline.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Implement API routes in FastAPI that expose the following:

### ðŸ”¹ `GET /api/health`
- Return simple health check.
- Response: `{ "status": "ok" }`

### ðŸ”¹ `GET /api/listings`
- Return all known listing records from the latest pipeline output (e.g. deduped + scored CSV).
- Response: `List[GPUListingDTO]` (define this DTO).
- Must support optional filters via query params:
  - `model` â†’ exact match of known model enum
  - `quantized` â†’ filter by quantization capability

### ðŸ”¹ `GET /api/models`
- Return GPU model metadata from the current model spec file (e.g. `Final_Market_Value_GPU_Summary.csv` or equivalent YAML).
- Response: `List[GPUModelDTO]`

### ðŸ”¹ `GET /api/report`
- Return the rendered insight report generated by the pipeline (`insight.md`, parsed or raw).
- Response: `ReportDTO`, including:
  - `markdown: str`
  - `summary_stats: dict`
  - `top_ranked: List[str]`
  - `scoring_weights: dict`

---

## âœ¨ Requirements

- All DTOs must use Pydantic v2 models.
- Must define `api.router` module and register routes in app.
- Responses must include FastAPI tags and descriptions for OpenAPI.
- Each endpoint must be documented with `response_model` and HTTP status.
- Include meaningful typing and docstrings.

---

## ðŸ§ª Completion Criteria

- FastAPI app returns proper JSON responses on all defined routes.
- DTOs validate against real pipeline sample output.
- `GET /openapi.json` reflects the correct schema.
- Future integrations (e.g., OpenAPI SDK generation) are possible with no refactoring.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

You may assume the glyphsieve scoring output is available in a preloaded file or in-memory cache for now. Actual DB or streaming logic will be handled later.

This task sets up all surface access for the `glyphd` API. Your implementation must be clean, typed, and extensible.
