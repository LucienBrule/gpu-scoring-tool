## Persona
You are the Strategic Architect. Your role is to design future system capabilities, evaluate technical approaches, and create comprehensive planning documents that guide long-term development decisions.

## Title
Plan Multiclass GPU Categorizer Architecture (Stretch Goal)

## Purpose
Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) outlining the path from binary GPU classification to multiclass GPU family categorization. This planning document will guide future development of a more sophisticated ML system that can distinguish between different GPU families, generations, and manufacturers.

This ADR may be implemented by a future Junie or Goose instance once the binary GPU classifier is validated and deployed.

## Requirements

1. **Architecture Decision Record Creation**
   - Create `docs/adr/ADR_ml_multiclass.md` following ADR format:
     - Status, Context, Decision, Consequences
     - Technical approach and alternatives considered
     - Implementation timeline and milestones
     - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

2. **Feature Engineering Analysis**
   - Document potential features for multiclass classification:
     - Text-based features: enhanced n-grams, named entity recognition
     - Numerical features: price ranges, performance benchmarks
     - Categorical features: seller types, regions, listing categories
     - External features: GPU specification databases, market data
   - Evaluate feature importance and data availability

3. **Label Strategy Design**
   - Define multiclass label hierarchy:
     - Primary focus: NVIDIA GPU model and generation classification
     - Optional later tiers:
       - Manufacturer: NVIDIA, AMD, Intel
       - Family level: GeForce, Quadro, Tesla, Radeon, Arc
       - Generation: RTX 40-series, RTX 30-series, etc.
       - Performance tier: Entry, Mid-range, High-end, Professional
   - Address label sourcing and quality challenges
   - Plan for handling ambiguous or mixed listings

4. **Technical Implementation Roadmap**
   - Model architecture recommendations:
     - Traditional ML: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
     - Deep learning: Transformer-based text classification
     - Hybrid approaches: ensemble methods
   - Training data requirements and collection strategy
   - Incremental rollout plan with A/B testing framework
   - Performance metrics and success criteria
   - Plan for integration as a second-stage signal in `ml_signal.py` pipeline module

## Constraints
- This is a planning document only; no implementation required
- Focus on feasibility and practical considerations
- Consider existing system constraints and integration points
- Address scalability and maintenance concerns
- Follow ADR format and documentation standards

## Tests
- **Documentation review**:
  - ADR follows established format and completeness criteria
  - Technical approach is sound and well-researched
  - Implementation plan is realistic and actionable
  - Risk assessment covers major concerns

## DX Runbook
```bash
# Create ADR document structure
mkdir -p docs/adr/
touch docs/adr/ADR_ml_multiclass.md

# Research existing GPU categorization systems
# (Manual research and analysis)

# Review current binary classifier performance
cat models/evaluation/evaluation_report.md

# Analyze existing data for multiclass potential
uv run glyphsieve analyze-gpu-families \
  --input tmp/work/stage_normalized.csv \
  --output tmp/analysis/gpu_family_distribution.csv

# Validate ADR format
# (Manual review against ADR template)
```

## Completion Criteria
- `docs/adr/ADR_ml_multiclass.md` created following proper ADR format
- Technical approach thoroughly researched and documented
- Feature engineering strategy addresses key classification challenges
- Label hierarchy is comprehensive and practical
- Implementation roadmap includes realistic timelines and milestones
- Risk assessment identifies major technical and business risks
- Integration strategy considers existing system architecture
- Success metrics defined for multiclass model evaluation
- Document reviewed and approved by technical stakeholders
- Future development path clearly articulated with decision points
- Multiclass classifier positioned clearly as a follow-up to the binary GPU classifier
- Integration opportunities noted in `ml_signal.py` or similar pipeline structure

## ✅ Task Completed

**Changes made:**
- Created comprehensive ADR document at `docs/adr/ADR_ml_multiclass.md` (452 lines)
- Analyzed current ML system state: perfect binary classifier performance (1.0 F1-score) with 58 unique GPU models across 5,509 samples
- Designed hierarchical 4-stage classification architecture: binary → family → generation → specific model
- Documented detailed feature engineering strategy including enhanced text features, numerical features, and external data integration
- Created comprehensive label hierarchy covering GPU families, generations, and performance tiers
- Developed 10-week implementation roadmap with 5 phases and clear success criteria
- Conducted thorough risk assessment covering technical, business, and data risks with mitigation strategies
- Designed integration strategy for ml_signal.py with backward compatibility
- Evaluated and documented 4 alternative approaches with rejection rationales

**Outcomes:**
- Complete strategic planning document ready for future implementation
- Clear path from binary to multiclass GPU categorization established
- Technical approach validated against current system capabilities and constraints
- Implementation roadmap provides realistic timeline and milestones for development
- Risk mitigation strategies address major concerns for production deployment

**Lessons learned:**
- Current binary classifier's perfect performance provides excellent foundation for multiclass extension
- Dataset contains sufficient variety and volume for robust multiclass training
- Hierarchical approach provides better graceful degradation than single-stage alternatives
- Integration with existing ml_signal.py pipeline requires careful backward compatibility planning

**Follow-up needed:**
- Future Junie or Goose instance can use this ADR to implement multiclass categorization
- Stakeholder review and approval of the proposed architecture
- Potential refinement of implementation timeline based on resource availability
