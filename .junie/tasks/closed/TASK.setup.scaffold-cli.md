## ðŸ§© Task: Scaffold `glyphsieve` CLI Interface

Junie, your task is to scaffold the CLI entrypoint for the `glyphsieve` module using `click`. This is the foundational CLI that will drive the entire GPU pipeline workflow.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Set up `glyphsieve` to be runnable as a CLI tool via:
  ```bash
  uv run glyphsieve
  ```

- Add a proper `__main__.py` that routes to `cli/main.py`
- Use `click` to create a CLI with the following subcommands:
  - `clean` (placeholder)
  - `normalize` (placeholder)
  - `score` (placeholder)

- Add a `--version` flag
- Use `rich` for CLI output formatting

---

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies to Add (with `uv add`, scoped to `glyphsieve/`)

```bash
uv add click pandas pydantic orjson python-dotenv
```

- âœ… `click` â€“ command line interface
- âœ… `pandas` â€“ CSV and tabular operations
- âœ… `pydantic` â€“ DTOs and schema validation
- âœ… `orjson` â€“ fast JSON parsing
- âœ… `python-dotenv` â€“ env loading (future use)

---

## ðŸ§± Directory Structure (Post-Task Expected)

```
glyphsieve/
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ glyphsieve/
        â”œâ”€â”€ __main__.py         # entrypoint
        â”œâ”€â”€ cli/
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py         # click CLI setup
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ clean.py        # placeholder module
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ normalize.py    # placeholder module
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ score.py        # placeholder module
        â”œâ”€â”€ core/               # transformation logic
        â””â”€â”€ utils/              # general helpers
```

---

## ðŸ“„ Notes

- Add proper `entry-points.console_scripts` to `pyproject.toml` (optional, for later installability)
- All CLI subcommands may be stubbed for now with simple `print()` statements
- Set up internal version tag (e.g. `glyphsieve.__version__`)

---

## âœ… Completion Criteria

- Running `uv run glyphsieve` yields CLI with help text and stubs
- `uv sync --all-packages` passes cleanly
- Subcommands stubbed and structured
- Pydantic is available and imported (even if unused yet)

Please close this task when complete and summarize anything notable at the end of this file.

## âœ… Task Completed

The `glyphsieve` CLI has been successfully scaffolded with the following components:

1. Added required dependencies:
   - click, pandas, pydantic, orjson, python-dotenv, rich

2. Created directory structure:
   - `__main__.py` entry point
   - `cli/` directory with subcommands
   - `core/` and `utils/` directories for future use

3. Implemented CLI with:
   - Main CLI group with version option
   - Three subcommands: `clean`, `normalize`, and `score`
   - Rich console formatting for output
   - Pydantic model in the `score` module

4. Updated package configuration:
   - Added version information to `__init__.py`
   - Updated entry points in `pyproject.toml`

All completion criteria have been met:
- Running `uv run glyphsieve` yields CLI with help text and stubs
- `uv sync --all-packages` passes cleanly
- Subcommands are stubbed and structured
- Pydantic is available and imported

The CLI is now ready for further development of the actual functionality in each subcommand.
