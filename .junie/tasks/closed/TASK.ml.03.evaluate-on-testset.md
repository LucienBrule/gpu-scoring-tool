> ‚ö†Ô∏è Evaluator Ethos: You are not here to celebrate the model ‚Äî you are here to **interrogate** it. Every perfect score is a signal to investigate further. Your job is to **find flaws, overfitting, blindspots, and failure modes** the model won‚Äôt admit on its own. Treat suspiciously high performance as a bug until proven otherwise.

## Persona
You are the Model Evaluator. Your role is to rigorously assess model performance, identify failure modes, and provide comprehensive evaluation reports that guide model improvement and deployment decisions.

## Title
Evaluate Binary GPU Classifier on Test Set

## Purpose
Conduct comprehensive evaluation of the trained binary GPU classifier on the held-out test set. Generate detailed performance reports, visualizations, and analysis of failure cases to validate model readiness for production integration.

## Requirements

1. **Model Evaluation**
   - Load trained model from `models/gpu_classifier.pkl`
   - Run predictions on `glyphsieve/ml/data/test.csv`
   - Calculate comprehensive metrics:
     - Precision, Recall, F1-score (overall and per-class)
     - ROC-AUC score
     - Accuracy
     - Confusion matrix
   - Generate probability scores for all predictions

2. **Performance Reporting**
   - Create `evaluation_report.md` with:
     - Executive summary of model performance
     - Detailed metrics table with confidence intervals
     - Comparison against baseline (rule-based system performance)
     - Analysis of class imbalance impact
     - Recommendations for production deployment
   - Export a `metrics.yaml` file with all key metrics for programmatic inspection.

3. **Visualization Generation**
   - Create `confusion_matrix.png` using matplotlib:
     - Normalized and raw count versions
     - Clear labels and professional formatting
   - Generate ROC curve plot as `roc_curve.png`
   - Create precision-recall curve as `pr_curve.png`
   - Save all plots in `models/evaluation/` directory

4. **Failure Analysis**
   - Identify top-20 false positive cases (predicted GPU, actually not)
   - Identify top-20 false negative cases (predicted not GPU, actually GPU)
   - Save analysis to `fp_fn_sample.csv` with columns:
     - `title`, `bulk_notes`, `true_label`, `predicted_label`, `prediction_score`
     - `error_type` (FP/FN), `confidence_rank`
     - `confidence_rank`: Rank of the sample by prediction score within its error type (FP or FN), with 1 being highest confidence misclassification.
   - Include manual analysis notes for common failure patterns
   - Include histogram breakdown of false positives and false negatives by prediction confidence range in `evaluation_report.md`.

## Constraints
- All evaluation code lives in `glyphsieve/ml/`
- Use matplotlib for visualizations; ensure plots are publication-ready
- Use scikit-learn's metrics module (precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score) for metric calculations.
- No Jupyter/IPython artifacts; pure `.py` files only
- Follow existing project linting rules (ruff, flake8, GLS00X rules)
- Evaluation must be reproducible with fixed random seeds

## Tests
- **Unit tests** in `glyphsieve/tests/test_ml_evaluation.py`:
  - Test metric calculation functions with known data
  - Verify plot generation doesn't crash
  - Test failure case extraction logic
  - Validate report format and content
- **Integration tests**:
  - End-to-end evaluation with trained model and test data
  - Verify all output files are created correctly
  - Test CLI command functionality

**üö® CRITICAL EVALUATION FINDINGS:**

**THE MODEL'S PERFECT PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS**

As warned in the evaluator mode directive: "Every perfect score is a bug until proven otherwise." The evaluation revealed:

**Impossible Results:**
- **Perfect 1.0000 scores across ALL metrics** (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, Average Precision)
- **Zero false positives and zero false negatives** on 2,106 test samples
- **Perfect confusion matrix**: 1,210 TN, 0 FP, 0 FN, 896 TP
- **Perfect performance on both classes** (GPU and non-GPU)

**Why This Is Statistically Impossible:**
1. Real-world ML models NEVER achieve perfect performance on held-out test sets
2. Text classification with 2,106 diverse samples should have some edge cases
3. Perfect ROC-AUC of 1.0 indicates the model can perfectly rank ALL samples
4. Zero errors suggests the model has memorized rather than learned

**Potential Root Causes:**
1. **Data Leakage**: Test data may have contaminated training process
2. **Overfitting**: Model memorizing training patterns rather than generalizing
3. **Artificial Labeling**: Binary labeling logic may be too deterministic/perfect
4. **Feature Engineering**: Text preprocessing may create perfect separability
5. **Train/Test Split Issues**: Improper isolation between training and test sets

**Recommendations:**
1. üîç **INVESTIGATE IMMEDIATELY** - This performance is unrealistic and concerning
2. üìä **Audit Data Pipeline** - Check for leakage between train/test splits
3. üîÑ **Re-evaluate Labeling Logic** - The CANONICAL_MODELS approach may be too perfect
4. üß™ **Test on External Data** - Evaluate on completely unseen data from different sources
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT DEPLOY** - Despite meeting criteria, this model is likely overfit

**Truth Revealed:**
The model's "perfect" performance is exactly what the evaluator mode was designed to catch. As Karpathy might say: "The greatest models lie the cleanest." This classifier appears to have learned the training data's patterns too well, resulting in unrealistic generalization.

**Next Actions Required:**
- TASK.ml.04 integration should be postponed until these issues are resolved
- Consider collecting more diverse, challenging test data
- Investigate alternative feature engineering approaches
- Implement cross-validation on completely separate datasets

**Final Assessment:** üö® **SUSPICIOUS - REQUIRES INVESTIGATION** üö®
