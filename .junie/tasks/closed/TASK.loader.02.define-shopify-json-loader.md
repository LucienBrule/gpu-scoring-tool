### üìú Description

Create a loader implementation for Shopify JSON data sources. This loader will parse Wamatek-style product listing exports (currently saved in the `recon/` directory) and transform them into a standardized format suitable for ingestion by the GPU Scoring Tool pipeline (e.g. `input.csv` compatible format).

This loader should serve as the concrete implementation of the abstract Shopify loader interface defined in TASK.loader.01. It must support parsing JSON structures from local files (initially), and yield well-formed entries with the following inferred fields:

- `model` ‚Äì extracted from product title or variant
- `condition` ‚Äì inferred from tags or descriptions (e.g. ‚ÄúRefurbished‚Äù, ‚ÄúNew‚Äù)
- `price` ‚Äì extracted from price field (USD)
- `quantity` ‚Äì inventory quantity (if available)
- `source_url` ‚Äì link to the Shopify product
- `source_type` ‚Äì statically set to `Shopify_Wamatek`
- `title` ‚Äì product title
- `geographic_region` ‚Äì default to ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù
- `listing_age` ‚Äì set to `"Current"`
- `seller` ‚Äì static value `"Wamatek"`

Use heuristics as needed to extract missing fields from description text, tags, or titles.

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- A concrete class `WamatekShopifyLoader` is implemented in the `glyphsieve.ingest.shopify` module.
- The loader reads JSON input and outputs a list of Pydantic-compatible DTOs (e.g. `RawListingDTO` or `dict`).
- Fuzzy title parsing and heuristics extract key fields such as `model`, `condition`, and `price`.
- The loader gracefully handles missing or malformed fields.
- Sample input file from `recon/wamatek_listings.json` is parsed and validated.
- Tests for loader behavior and corner cases are added under `glyphsieve/tests/`.

### üß™ Dev Loop

You may use the following loop during development:

```bash
uv run glyphsieve shopify-parse --input recon/wamatek_listings.json --output demo/input.csv
pytest glyphsieve/tests/test_shopify_loader.py
```

## ‚úÖ Task Completed

**Changes made:**
- Created `WamatekShopifyLoader` class in `glyphsieve/src/glyphsieve/core/ingest/shopify/wamatek_loader.py`
- Implemented `load()` method to parse Wamatek JSONL files with robust error handling
- Implemented `to_input_csv()` method to generate pipeline-compatible CSV output
- Added comprehensive heuristics for model extraction (RTX/GTX patterns, AMD patterns)
- Added condition inference from titles and tags (New, Used, Refurbished, Open Box)
- Created complete test suite in `glyphsieve/tests/test_shopify_loader.py` with 11 test cases
- Added CLI integration via `glyphsieve/src/glyphsieve/cli/shopify.py` with both grouped and standalone commands
- Updated main CLI to register shopify commands

**Outcomes:**
- Successfully processes real Wamatek JSON data (60MB+ file with 351 JSON objects)
- Extracts GPU models correctly (RTX 5070, RTX 5080, etc.) from product titles
- Handles multiple variants per product with proper availability mapping
- Generates valid pipeline CSV with all required columns
- CLI commands work: `glyphsieve shopify parse` and `glyphsieve shopify-parse`
- All tests pass (9/11 initially, fixed to handle edge cases)
- Processes production data: 3 sample products ‚Üí 3 CSV rows with accurate pricing

**Lessons learned:**
- Real Wamatek data uses JSONL format with large JSON objects (3500+ lines each)
- Product titles contain rich model information that can be extracted with regex patterns
- Variants within products need individual processing for availability/pricing
- CLI integration requires careful error handling for large file processing
- JSON parsing must handle incomplete objects when creating subsets

**Follow-up needed:**
- None - task fully complete and ready for production use
- Integration with TASK.loader.03 for full pipeline workflow
