## Persona
You are the Model Architect. Your role is to design, train, and optimize machine learning models that can accurately classify GPU listings and augment rule-based systems with probabilistic predictions.

## Title
Train Binary GPU Classifier with TF-IDF and Logistic Regression

## Purpose
Develop a baseline binary classification pipeline using TF-IDF feature extraction and Logistic Regression to identify NVIDIA GPUs from listing text. The model will serve as the foundation for augmenting the existing rule-based normalization system.

## Requirements

1. **Feature Engineering Pipeline**
   - Implement TF-IDF vectorization on combined `title` + `bulk_notes` text
   - Text preprocessing: lowercase, remove special characters, tokenization
   - Configure TF-IDF parameters: max_features, ngram_range, min_df, max_df
   - Handle missing text values gracefully

2. **Model Training**
   - Use Logistic Regression as the baseline classifier
   - Implement hyperparameter grid search with cross-validation:
     - TF-IDF: max_features [1000, 5000, 10000], ngram_range [(1,1), (1,2)]
     - LogisticRegression: C [0.1, 1.0, 10.0], solver ['liblinear', 'lbfgs']
   - Use 5-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter selection
   - Select best model based on F1-score

3. **Model Persistence**
   - Save trained pipeline to `models/gpu_classifier.pkl` using joblib/pickle
   - Create `models/` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Save training metrics to `models/metrics.yaml` including:
     - Best hyperparameters
     - Cross-validation scores (precision, recall, F1, accuracy)
     - Training set size and class distribution
     - Training timestamp

4. **CLI Interface**
   - Create `glyphsieve/ml/train_gpu_classifier.py` with Typer CLI
   - Command: `glyphsieve ml-train`
   - Parameters:
     - `--input`: path to training CSV (default: glyphsieve/ml/data/train.csv)
     - `--output`: path to save model (default: models/gpu_classifier.pkl)
     - `--cv-folds`: number of CV folds (default: 5)
     - `--verbose`: enable detailed logging

## Constraints
- Offline, CPU-only training; no cloud notebooks or CUDA dependencies
- All ML code lives in `glyphsieve/ml/`; keep the rest of the project import-free from heavy libs
- No Jupyter/IPython artifacts; pure `.py` files only
- Model training must be runnable headlessly using `safe-run.sh`
- Follow existing project linting rules (ruff, flake8, GLS00X rules)
- Update `pyproject.toml` dependencies and run `uv sync --all-packages`
- Must use `scikit-learn` for both feature extraction (TF-IDF) and model training (LogisticRegression, GridSearchCV)
- Use `joblib` or `pickle` for model serialization (`joblib` preferred)

## Tests
- **Unit tests** in `glyphsieve/tests/test_ml_training.py`:
  - Test feature extraction pipeline with sample text data
  - Verify hyperparameter grid search functionality
  - Test model serialization/deserialization
  - Validate metrics.yaml format and content
- **Integration tests**:
  - End-to-end training with sample dataset
  - Verify model file creation and loadability
  - Test CLI command with various parameters

## DX Runbook
```bash
# Train the model (short run for testing)
uv run glyphsieve ml-train \
  --input glyphsieve/ml/data/train.csv \
  --output models/gpu_classifier.pkl \
  --verbose

# Train with safe-run for long processes
./.junie/scripts/safe-run.sh -n ml-train -b -- \
  uv run glyphsieve ml-train \
    --input tmp/work/stage_normalized.csv \
    --output models/gpu_classifier.pkl

# Check training results
cat models/metrics.yaml
ls -la models/

# Run tests
pytest glyphsieve/tests/test_ml_training.py -v

# Lint check
uv run ruff glyphsieve/ml/
uv run flake8 glyphsieve/ml/

# Ensure required packages are added (once only) TO THE GLYPHSIEVE PACKAGE
uv add scikit-learn joblib

# Update dependencies
uv sync --all-packages --all-extras
```

## Completion Criteria
- Trained model saved as `models/gpu_classifier.pkl`
- Training metrics saved as `models/metrics.yaml` with CV scores
- CLI command `glyphsieve ml-train` works with all specified parameters
- Cross-validation F1-score â‰¥ 0.90 on training data
- Hyperparameter grid search completes successfully
- All unit and integration tests pass
- Code passes all linting checks (ruff, flake8, GLS00X rules)
- Dependencies updated in `pyproject.toml` and synced
- Training process can run headlessly via `safe-run.sh`

## âœ… Task Completed

**Changes made:**
