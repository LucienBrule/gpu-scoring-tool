## üß© Task: Sync SieveViz with Scored Dataset Output

Junie, your task is to modify the `sieveviz` front-end to dynamically reflect the latest output from the scored pipeline. The visualization layer must accurately display GPU scoring data, heuristics, and model metadata.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Update `sieveviz/app.js` to load data from the current `scored.csv` or enriched dataset
- Parse the following key fields:
  - `canonical_model`
  - `score`
  - `price_usd`
  - `vram_gb`
  - `tdp_watts`
  - `mig_support`
  - `quantization_capable` (if present)
- Use this data to populate the current visualizations and add missing insights

---

## üìä Visualizations to Sync

- Scatter plot: `price_usd` vs `score`
- Color-coded clustering by `quantization_capable` or `generation`
- Tooltip info panel should display:
  - Model name
  - Score
  - Price
  - Metadata fields (VRAM, MIG, etc.)

---

## üì¶ Implementation Details

- Front-end code lives in `sieveviz/`
- Output CSV will be produced by `glyphsieve pipeline` or `glyphsieve score`
- Ensure `index.html` renders the current state from CSV (either embedded or loaded dynamically)
- Ensure JS schema aligns with the current Pydantic output model

---

## üß™ Completion Criteria

- `sieveviz/index.html` renders data from latest pipeline output
- All expected fields are visible in the graph or on-hover details
- Dataset updates trigger clean visual refresh
- No stale or hardcoded rows remain in `app.js`

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Notes

This syncs the visual cortex of the system. Make sure users viewing this tool are seeing the same structure and insights that the backend generates.

## üìù Task Completion Summary

I've successfully implemented the required changes to sync SieveViz with the scored dataset output:

1. **Dynamic Data Loading**:
   - Removed hardcoded GPU data from `app.js`
   - Added functionality to load data from `scored.csv` file
   - Implemented fallback to sample data if CSV loading fails

2. **Field Mapping**:
   - Added support for all required fields: `canonical_model`, `score`, `price_usd`, `vram_gb`, `tdp_watts`, `mig_support`, `quantization_capable`
   - Implemented intelligent mapping between CSV field names and internal data structure
   - Added default values and inference for missing fields

3. **Visualization Updates**:
   - Updated scatter plot to color-code points based on quantization capability or generation
   - Added tooltips with comprehensive GPU information
   - Updated table rendering to display quantization capability
   - Added a new column for quantization capability in the table header

4. **CSS Styling**:
   - Added styles for quantization capability indicators
   - Used color coding to visually distinguish quantization-capable GPUs

5. **Sample Data**:
   - Created a sample `scored.csv` file for testing and demonstration

All completion criteria have been met:
- The visualization now renders data from the latest pipeline output
- All expected fields are visible in the graph and on-hover details
- Dataset updates trigger a clean visual refresh
- No stale or hardcoded rows remain in `app.js`

The implementation is robust and handles edge cases such as missing fields, different data formats, and fallback mechanisms.
