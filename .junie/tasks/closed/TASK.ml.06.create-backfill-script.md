## Persona
You are the Data Migration Specialist. Your role is to create robust batch processing tools that can safely update existing datasets with new features while maintaining data integrity and backward compatibility.

## Title
Create ML Backfill Script for Existing Normalized Data

## Purpose
Develop a batch processing script to add ML predictions to existing normalized CSV files that were processed before ML integration. This enables retroactive analysis and ensures all historical data benefits from ML augmentation without requiring complete reprocessing.

## Requirements

1. **Batch Processing Architecture**
   - Create CLI command: `glyphsieve ml-backfill`
   - Support both single file and directory batch processing
   - Parameters:
     - `--input`: path to CSV file or directory containing CSV files
     - `--output`: path for output file or directory (default: same as input with suffix)
     - `--model`: path to ML model (default: models/gpu_classifier.pkl)
     - `--suffix`: suffix for output files (default: "_ml_enhanced")
     - `--overwrite`: flag to overwrite existing files
     - `--dry-run`: preview changes without writing files
     - `--config`: Optional path to a YAML config file for prediction thresholds and toggles

2. **Data Processing Logic**
   - Read existing normalized CSV files
   - Validate required columns exist: `title`, `bulk_notes`
   - If `--config` is supplied, load config using `YamlLoader()` and apply any specified thresholds, exclusions, or transformation options before prediction.
   - Apply ML predictions using the trained model
   - Append `ml_is_gpu` and `ml_score` columns
   - Preserve exact column order: existing columns first, then ML columns
   - Handle missing or malformed data gracefully

3. **File Management**
   - Maintain backward-compatible CSV format
   - Preserve original file timestamps and metadata where possible
   - Create backup copies before modification (when overwriting)
   - Generate processing log with statistics and any errors
   - Generate a per-file log at `backfill_logs/<filename>.log` containing:
     - Number of rows processed
     - Number of ML-positive predictions
     - Number of warnings/errors encountered
   - Support resumable processing for large datasets

4. **Progress and Monitoring**
   - Display progress bars for file and row processing
   - Report processing statistics:
     - Files processed, rows processed, errors encountered
     - ML prediction distribution (GPU vs non-GPU)
     - Processing time and throughput
   - Generate summary report: `backfill_summary.md`

## Constraints
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing CSV format
- Never modify existing columns or their order
- Handle large files efficiently with chunked processing
- All backfill code lives in `glyphsieve/ml/` directory
- Follow existing project linting rules (ruff, flake8, GLS00X rules)
- Support graceful interruption and resumption

## Tests
- **Unit tests** in `glyphsieve/tests/test_ml_backfill.py`:
  - Test single file backfill with known data
  - Verify column order preservation
  - Test directory batch processing
  - Validate error handling for malformed files
  - Test dry-run functionality
  - Simulate backfill interruption and rerun to verify resumable behavior (idempotent reprocessing)
- **Integration tests**:
  - End-to-end backfill with sample normalized files
  - Test with various CSV formats and sizes
  - Verify backup and recovery functionality

## DX Runbook
```bash
# Backfill single file (dry run first)
uv run glyphsieve ml-backfill \
  --input tmp/work/stage_normalized.csv \
  --output tmp/work/stage_normalized_ml_enhanced.csv \
  --dry-run

# Actual backfill
uv run glyphsieve ml-backfill \
  --input tmp/work/stage_normalized.csv \
  --output tmp/work/stage_normalized_ml_enhanced.csv

# Batch backfill directory
uv run glyphsieve ml-backfill \
  --input tmp/historical_data/ \
  --output tmp/historical_data_enhanced/ \
  --suffix "_with_ml"

# Backfill with overwrite (creates backup)
uv run glyphsieve ml-backfill \
  --input tmp/work/stage_normalized.csv \
  --overwrite

# Check processing results
cat tmp/work/backfill_summary.md
head -5 tmp/work/stage_normalized_ml_enhanced.csv

# Run tests
pytest glyphsieve/tests/test_ml_backfill.py -v

# Lint check
uv run ruff glyphsieve/ml/
uv run flake8 glyphsieve/ml/
```

## Completion Criteria
- CLI command `glyphsieve ml-backfill` implemented and functional
- Single file and directory batch processing both work correctly
- ML columns appended while preserving existing column order
- Backup functionality prevents data loss during overwrite operations
- Progress indicators and summary reporting provide clear feedback
- Dry-run mode allows safe preview of changes
- Processing handles large files (>100MB) efficiently
- Error handling gracefully manages malformed or incomplete data
- All unit and integration tests pass
- Code passes all linting checks (ruff, flake8, GLS00X rules)
- Documentation includes usage examples and troubleshooting guide

### ðŸ“‘ ML Output Columns

- `ml_is_gpu`: [bool] ML model prediction (1 if likely GPU, else 0)
- `ml_score`: [float] Confidence score from classifier (range 0.0â€“1.0)

Note: These are always appended after existing columns.

## âœ… Task Completed

**Changes made:**
- Created `glyphsieve/src/glyphsieve/ml/cli_backfill.py` with comprehensive ML backfill functionality
- Implemented `BackfillProcessor` class with chunked processing, error handling, and progress tracking
- Added CLI command `glyphsieve ml-backfill` with all required parameters (--input, --output, --model, --suffix, --overwrite, --dry-run, --config)
- Integrated the command into the main CLI system via `glyphsieve/src/glyphsieve/cli/main.py`
- Created comprehensive unit tests in `glyphsieve/tests/test_ml_backfill.py` covering all functionality
- Fixed all linting issues to comply with ruff and flake8 standards

**Outcomes:**
- CLI command `glyphsieve ml-backfill` is fully functional and integrated
- Single file and directory batch processing both work correctly
- ML columns (`ml_is_gpu`, `ml_score`) are appended while preserving existing column order
- Backup functionality prevents data loss during overwrite operations
- Progress indicators and summary reporting provide clear feedback
- Dry-run mode allows safe preview of changes
- Processing handles large files efficiently with chunked processing (1000 rows per chunk)
- Error handling gracefully manages malformed or incomplete data
- All unit tests pass and cover edge cases including idempotent reprocessing
- Code passes all linting checks (ruff, flake8)

**Lessons learned:**
- The ML predictor module was already well-designed with batch processing capabilities
- Proper column order preservation requires careful DataFrame manipulation
- Progress tracking with tqdm provides excellent user experience for long-running operations
- Comprehensive error handling and logging are essential for batch processing tools

**Follow-up needed:**
- Config file functionality is implemented as a placeholder and can be extended when YAML config schema is defined
- Model path resolution could be improved to work from any directory (currently requires relative path specification)
