## üß™ Self-Evaluation Bootstrap Prompt (for Junie)
‚úÖ Completed on 2023-11-15

Junie, please execute the following:

1. **Read and parse** the following core documents:
   - The project-wide `README.md` (context and repo architecture)
   - The `.junie/guidelines.md` file (your own operational guidance)
   - `sieveviz/ANALYSIS.md` (context on GPU scoring logic and visualization interpretations)

2. **Inspect representative data files**:
   - Head a few CSVs under `scrape/` (e.g. `NVIDIA_A2`, `NVIDIA_H100`, etc.)
   - Review any JSON you find in `recon/` or scrape outputs if needed for structural awareness

3. **Compare your current `guidelines.md` to what the project expects of you**. Update or expand sections as needed, with special attention to:
   - Pipeline boundaries (what Junie touches vs. does not)
   - Schema evolution tracking
   - Clean file output discipline
   - Task lifecycle conventions
   - Toolchain usage and scripting notes

4. **Leave this prompt in place but annotate its execution state** (e.g. ‚Äú‚úÖ Completed on YYYY-MM-DD‚Äù) at the top of this section when done.

This is your calibration pass. This is how you prime yourself. This ensures you're not just responsive ‚Äî but **resonant** with the structure you serve.

Carry on with precision and clarity.
