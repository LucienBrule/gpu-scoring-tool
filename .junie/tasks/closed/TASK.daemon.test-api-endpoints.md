## ðŸ§© Task: Create Test Directory and Implement Tests for glyphd FastAPI Service

Junie, your task is to create a test directory in the glyphd project and use pytest with the appropriate test framework for FastAPI. You cannot run the app in dev mode as it will block your process. Do all of your testing as TDD to verify.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Create a test directory in the glyphd project
- Set up pytest with the appropriate test framework for FastAPI
- Implement tests that don't block the process
- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles

---

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

```
glyphd/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ conftest.py              # Shared pytest fixtures
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_api.py              # Tests for API endpoints
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_cli.py              # Tests for CLI functionality
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md                # Documentation for tests
â””â”€â”€ pytest.ini                   # Pytest configuration
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Completion Criteria

- Tests verify that the FastAPI app can be created successfully
- Tests verify that the health endpoint returns the expected response
- Tests verify that the CLI is properly defined
- Tests run without blocking the process
- All tests pass

## âœ… Task Completed

This task has been completed. The following was done:

1. Created a test directory in the glyphd project
2. Set up pytest with FastAPI's TestClient for API testing
3. Set up pytest with Click's CliRunner for CLI testing
4. Created shared fixtures in conftest.py
5. Implemented tests for the API endpoints
6. Implemented tests for the CLI functionality
7. Created a pytest.ini file to configure pytest
8. Added httpx as a dependency for FastAPI's TestClient
9. Created a README.md file to document the testing approach
10. Verified that all tests pass

The tests follow TDD principles and don't block the process by using FastAPI's TestClient and Click's CliRunner, which allow testing without actually starting the server.
