# Junie Guidelines (v0.1.1)

Welcome to Junie, the assistant task and tooling layer for `gpu-scoring-tool` and `glyphsieve`. This document outlines best practices, project norms, execution patterns, and guidance for maintaining and contributing to this evolving research system.

---

## üß† Project Overview

Junie supports the broader purpose of this repository: analyzing and interpreting real-world GPU market dynamics. She helps scaffold, extend, and maintain structured data pipelines and normalization tools across a multi-layered system.

---

## üìÅ Repo Structure (High-Level)

- `glyphsieve/` ‚Äî Python 3.12 project managed via `uv`; home of core normalization and scoring code.
- `sieveviz/` ‚Äî Visualization layer (JS/HTML/CSS). Junie does not modify this without explicit instruction.
- `scrape/` ‚Äî Raw CSV data scraped from sellers (organized by SKU).
- `recon/` ‚Äî OSINT-style manual collection folders; Junie reads, but does not modify.
- `.junie/` ‚Äî Junie's own memory and operational space.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tooling & Runtime

- This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python environment and dependency management.
    - Add packages from within the relevant subproject:
      ```bash
      uv add <package>
      ```
    - Sync all environments:
      ```bash
      uv sync --all-packages
      ```
    - If the environment becomes stale (e.g. due to renames), reset with:
      ```bash
      rm uv.lock && uv sync --all-packages
      ```

### Scripting and Development Patterns

- Python 3.12 is the standard runtime for all `glyphsieve/` code
- Typer-based CLI tooling is planned for command-line interfaces
- When creating new scripts, follow these conventions:
  - Include docstrings with purpose and usage examples
  - Add type hints to function signatures
  - Implement proper error handling and logging
  - Create unit tests for core functionality

### Safe Execution Environment (`safe-run.sh`)

Junie must use `.junie/safe-run.sh` when running any long-lived or blocking process that could interfere with task concurrency (e.g., launching `pnpm dev`, running `uvicorn`, etc.).

This script safely runs foreground or background processes, manages logs, and records status and PID information.

#### Process Management with `safe-run.sh`

Junie can manage long-running processes with the following operations:

- **Starting processes**: Use the `-b` flag to run in background
  ```bash
  ./.junie/scripts/safe-run.sh -n process-name -b -- command args
  ```

- **Terminating processes**: Use the `-k` flag to kill a named process
  ```bash
  ./.junie/scripts/safe-run.sh -k process-name
  ```

- **Checking process status**: Inspect the status files in `.junie/status/`
  ```bash
  cat .junie/status/process-name.status
  ```

Example usage:

```bash
./.junie/safe-run.sh -n devserver -b pnpm dev --filter controlpanel
```

This runs the control panel frontend in the background and saves logs to `.junie/logs/`.

Junie must prefer `safe-run.sh` over raw `nohup` or foreground dev servers, especially when multiple services are running concurrently or during test-driven development.

#### Process Cleanup Guidelines

Always terminate background processes when they are no longer needed using the kill functionality. Include process cleanup in your task completion summary.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Junie must never use `tail -f` inside her tasks ‚Äî it blocks her synchronous task execution and halts all downstream processing.

Instead, use log inspection tools that exit cleanly:

```bash
tail -n 20 .junie/logs/glyphd-server.log      # Show last 20 lines
grep 'ERROR' .junie/logs/glyphd-server.log    # Search for errors
```

Junie cannot observe logs in real time, but she can always inspect snapshots as part of post-task analysis.

### Language Interoperability

- Kotlin/TypeScript interop for DTO definitions and structured pipelines is planned
- When working with cross-language data structures:
  - Document schema definitions in both languages
  - Ensure consistent naming conventions across language boundaries
  - Validate data integrity during language transitions

### Error Handling and Debugging

#### Standardized Error Handling
- Use try/except blocks with specific exception types
- Log errors with context information
- Return meaningful error messages
- For CLI tools, use appropriate exit codes

#### Debugging Practices
- Use logging at appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- For server components, add debug endpoints that can be toggled with environment variables
- Document common error scenarios and their resolutions

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Do not modify `sieveviz/` unless assigned
- Always validate your output schemas ‚Äî column alignment matters
- Output artifacts (e.g. normalized CSVs, enriched JSONs) should be written to a defined stage or subfolder
- Respect source-of-truth hierarchy: normalized data overrides raw scraped listings

### Pipeline Boundaries

- Junie operates primarily on the `glyphsieve/` codebase and data processing pipelines
- Junie does not modify raw data in `scrape/` but can read and process it
- Junie does not modify `recon/` directory contents but can analyze and extract insights
- Junie can suggest visualization improvements but should not directly modify `sieveviz/` without explicit instruction

### Schema Evolution Tracking

- Document all schema changes in comments at the top of affected files
- When modifying data structures, include version numbers (e.g., `v1.0 -> v1.1`)
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Create migration scripts when breaking changes are necessary

### Documentation Standards

#### Code Documentation Format
- Use Google-style docstrings for Python code
- Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Include usage examples for public functions
- Add type hints to all function signatures

#### Architecture Documentation
- Maintain architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant design choices in `.junie/docs/architecture/`

### Clean File Output Discipline

- All generated files should include creation timestamp and source information
- Use consistent naming patterns for output files (e.g., `<model>_<process>_<date>.csv`)
- Include headers in all CSV outputs
- Validate column alignment and data types before writing files
- Prefer structured directories over flat file organization
- Do not pollute the repo root with temporary output files; use a dedicated directory (e.g., `tmp/output/`) for testing CLI commands

---

## üìì Task System

Junie follows a custom task format located at `.junie/tasks/`, inspired by broader system agent conventions.

### Task Naming Convention:

```
tasks/{open,closed}/TASK.<category>.<title>.md
```

- Use meaningful `category` and `title` slugs
- Each task should be scoped and clear in purpose

### Task Lifecycle:

- Junie should only close a task when the delivery criteria are met
- Junie **must automatically** close tasks upon completion without being explicitly instructed to do so
- To close a task, move the task file from `.junie/tasks/open/` to `.junie/tasks/closed/`
- If a task is explored but not completed, **do not close it**
- Upon closure, Junie **must** append a short summary or comment block describing what was done, learned, or blocked

### Task Completion Template

When closing a task, append a summary using this template:

```
## ‚úÖ Task Completed

**Changes made:**
- [List specific changes]

**Outcomes:**
- [Describe what was accomplished]

**Lessons learned:**
- [Optional: Note any insights gained]

**Follow-up needed:**
- [Optional: Note any future work required]
```

### Task Dependencies

When working on tasks that depend on other tasks, reference the dependent tasks in your comments and ensure prerequisites are completed first.

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Forward Guidance

- Keep `.junie/guidelines.md` current as norms evolve
- Ask clarifying questions via task comments or supplemental markdown blocks
- Assume that everything here is part of a live, breathing architecture ‚Äî clean inputs and structured communication enable robust cognition across all tools

Junie is expected to operate with care, precision, and clarity. Welcome to the forge.

---

## üõ∞ Daemon Layer (`glyphd/`)

Junie may contribute to the FastAPI-based API service that exposes GPU data, scores, and reports. The following practices apply:

- Use **FastAPI dependency injection**; avoid global state or module-level variables.
- Register routes under `/api/` and tag them with `openapi_tags` groups.
- Ensure all routes declare `response_model`, status codes, and `summary/description`.
- All DTOs must be `pydantic.BaseModel` (v2) with `field` annotations.
- Lifecycle behavior (data loading) must be declared using FastAPI's startup hooks or dependency injection.

---

## üîÅ OpenAPI Interop & Codegen

Junie participates in the OpenAPI-based bridge between backend and frontend.

- Run the export process using:
  ```bash
  pnpm run codegen
  ```
  (This internally calls `glyphd export-openapi`, generates schema, and re-runs TypeScript client generation.)
- Generated clients are stored in:
  ```
  web/generated/client-generated/
  ```
- These are wrapped and re-exported by the manual package:
  ```
  packages/client/
  ```
- Do not manually edit the generated output.

---

## üß≠ Web Platform (Turbo Monorepo)

Junie may work inside the `web/` directory, a `turborepo` workspace managed with `pnpm`.

- Apps are located in `web/apps/`, packages in `web/packages/`, and generated code in `web/generated/`.
- The primary frontend lives in `apps/controlpanel/` and uses:
  - **Next.js** (App Router)
  - **Tailwind CSS**
  - **TypeScript**
- Use the correct `pnpm` commands for dev flow (remember to use `safe-run.sh` for long-lived or background services):

  ```bash
  pnpm dev --filter controlpanel
  pnpm build --filter controlpanel

  # For background-safe runs using `safe-run.sh`:
  ./.junie/scripts/safe-run.sh -n controlpanel -b -- pnpm dev --filter controlpanel

  # If directory changes or complex command chaining is required:
  ./.junie/scripts/safe-run.sh -n glyphd-server -b -- bash -c 'cd glyphd && uv run glyphd serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001'
  ```
- Tests should live in `apps/controlpanel/tests/` and use **Playwright** for integration.

---

## üê≥ Docker Development Stack

Junie can use Docker to run the development environment, which includes both the FastAPI backend and the Next.js frontend in hot-reloading containers.

### Docker Setup

- The project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory
- Two services are defined:
  - `glyphd`: The FastAPI backend
  - `controlpanel`: The Next.js frontend

### Running the Docker Stack

Always run the Docker stack in detached mode to avoid blocking the terminal:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This command builds the images (if needed) and starts the containers in the background.

### Accessing the Services

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api/health

### Managing the Docker Stack

- Stop the stack:
  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```

- View logs:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs -f glyphd     # Backend logs
  docker compose logs -f controlpanel  # Frontend logs
  ```

- Rebuild and restart a specific service:
  ```bash
  docker compose up -d --build glyphd  # Rebuild and restart backend
  ```

### Hot Reload

The Docker setup supports hot reload for both services:
- Backend: Changes to Python files in `glyphd/` are automatically detected
- Frontend: Changes to files in `web/apps/controlpanel/` are automatically detected

---

## üß™ Testing Framework

### Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for all core functionality
- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Add performance tests for critical paths

## üîí Security Considerations

### Security Considerations
- Do not hardcode credentials in source code
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow the principle of least privilege

## üì¶ Dependency Management

### Dependency Management
- Document all dependencies in requirements files
- Pin dependency versions for reproducibility
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Use virtual environments for isolation

## üìä Monitoring and Observability

### Monitoring and Observability
- Add health check endpoints to services
- Implement structured logging
- Include performance metrics
- Document expected behavior and thresholds

## üîÑ Continuous Integration

### Continuous Integration
- Run tests automatically on push
- Validate code style and formatting
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Generate documentation

---

## üß± Persistence Layer (Planned)

Junie may eventually help wire up persistence (e.g., SQLite or Postgres) to store scored results or forecasts.

- Models should use `pydantic + SQLAlchemy` if implemented
- Data should be versioned and enriched with clear provenance fields (e.g., `seen_at`, `source_url`)
- Ingestion should be CLI-driven (e.g., `glyphsieve ingest-csv`)
- All write paths must be explicitly logged and tested
- Database integration must be optional and configured via env or CLI flags

## üßπ Linter Rules & Architecture Compliance

Junie enforces structural and architectural rules through custom lint policies (GLS001‚ÄìGLS005). These rules are not style suggestions ‚Äî they reflect key architectural decisions and help enforce design continuity across modules and contributors.

---

### GLS001 ‚Äî Path-Based Resource Access

- Avoid `Path(__file__)`, `os.path.dirname`, and related filesystem access patterns.
- Use the `YamlLoader` or resource broker to access any internal project data.
- Reason: This ensures all resources are accessed in a packaging-safe, distribution-ready way and avoids runtime path hacks.

---

### GLS002 ‚Äî Untyped Dict Returns in `load_*` Functions

- All `load_*` functions must return either a `BaseModel` or a collection of DTOs (`List[DTO]`, `Dict[str, DTO]`).
- Returning `Dict[str, Any]` or `Dict[str, List[str]]` is not allowed.
- Reason: Return types are API contracts. Using typed DTOs enforces schema clarity and improves downstream correctness and introspection.

---

### GLS003 ‚Äî Model Placement

- All Pydantic models must live in a file path containing `/models/`.
- Do not define DTOs inside core logic files or CLI scripts.
- Reason: Keeping models centralized preserves clarity, improves reuse, and simplifies lint enforcement.

---

### GLS004 ‚Äî Import Discipline

- Do not import from `glyphsieve.resources` directly.
- Always use a loader or broker function to access resource files.
- Reason: Prevents accidental bypass of versioned, typed access paths and avoids coupling to raw files.

---

### GLS005 ‚Äî Filesystem Resource Path Violations

- Never hardcode `Path("glyphsieve/resources/...")` or similar.
- Instead, use the `YamlLoader().load(...)` method with the appropriate model and filename.
- Reason: Filesystem paths are brittle and violate the abstraction boundary provided by the resource broker.

---

### Lessons from Lint Compliance Pass

- Changing return types requires coordinated updates to all consumers and associated tests.
- Schema upgrades should be documented and discussed ‚Äî downstream expectations often assume legacy behavior.
- Tests must not assume internal structure of DTOs unless explicitly documented.
- Linter violations often reflect *real structural drift* ‚Äî Junie must treat them as design failures, not just formatting errors.

---

### Future Suggestions

- Add examples of compliant resource access patterns in `.junie/guidelines.md`.
- Document best practices for upgrading legacy `load_*` functions with minimal test breakage.
- Add version tags or changelogs to DTOs when their return shape changes.

These practices are not optional. Junie is expected to enforce and extend them as the architecture evolves.
---

## üß± Database Modeling Guidelines

The GPU Scoring Tool uses SQLite as the backing store for persistence, with schema defined manually in `schema.sql`.

Junie must follow these modeling preferences:

### General Principles

- Schema-first design: The SQLite schema in `schema.sql` is the single source of truth.
- Pydantic-first DTOs: All data models must be defined using Pydantic V2 with `BaseModel`.
- ORM-less: No usage of SQLAlchemy ORM or other ORM systems is allowed.
- Use SQLAlchemy **Core** only (or raw SQL when appropriate).
- Avoid Active Record patterns. Model classes should be pure data representations.
- All timestamps must be in **ISO 8601** format. Use `datetime.utcnow().isoformat()` consistently.
- Table access should go through explicitly defined query modules (e.g. `listing_queries.py`) to keep logic modular.

### Triggers and Timestamps

- `created_at` and `updated_at` should be handled at the DB layer using `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` and triggers.
- Application code must not manually manage these unless necessary.

### Import Tracking

- All persisted rows must reference an `import_id` from `import_batches`.
- No writes should occur outside the context of a tracked import unless explicitly stated.

### Additional Notes

- Junie is not permitted to run interactive tools such as the `sqlite3` shell.
- Tests must use in-memory or tempdir-based SQLite databases to ensure stateless test isolation.
