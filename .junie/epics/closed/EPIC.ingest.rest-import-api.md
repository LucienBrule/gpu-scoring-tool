## EPIC: REST Ingestion API

### Overview
This Epic introduces and formalizes the ingestion pathway for scored GPU listing data through the `glyphd` FastAPI service. While CSV ingestion via CLI is stable, this Epic expands support to REST-based ingestion workflows to enable remote data submission, automation pipelines, and system interoperability.

## ✍️ Planning Commentary

**Current State Analysis (2025-08-01):**
The glyphd FastAPI service already has significant ingestion infrastructure in place:

- **Existing Functionality:**
  - `/api/persist/listings` endpoint accepts JSON arrays of `GPUListingDTO` objects
  - Complete SQLite schema with `ImportBatch`, `ScoredListing`, `Model`, and related tables
  - `SqliteListingStore` with `insert_listings`, `query_listings`, and `list_imports` methods
  - Import metadata tracking with `import_id`, timestamps, and record counts
  - `GPUListingDTO` already includes `import_id` and `import_index` fields

- **Missing Functionality:**
  - CSV file upload endpoint (multipart form-data)
  - File validation and schema checking before ingestion
  - Error handling for malformed CSV/JSON with detailed row-level feedback
  - Schema versioning support for API evolution
  - Integration with glyphsieve pipeline for normalization/scoring

**Architectural Context:**
- Database uses SQLite with comprehensive schema including import tracking
- All models use Pydantic v2 with proper field validation
- FastAPI app has OpenAPI documentation and proper dependency injection
- Storage layer is abstracted through `ListingStore` interface

### Scope & Intent
This Epic formalizes a **dual path ingestion** system for the `glyphd` FastAPI service, supporting both raw and scored GPU listing data. Its intent is to:
- **Raw CSV Ingestion:** Accept unprocessed CSV files that trigger normalization and scoring via the glyphsieve pipeline
- **Scored Data Ingestion:** Import already-processed listings from pipeline exports or external sources
- Provide counterpart functionality to existing CLI workflows while enabling remote and automated pipelines
- Ensure every ingest request is validated, annotated with import metadata (UUID, timestamp, row index), and persisted reliably
- Support comprehensive error reporting with row-level validation feedback and summary statistics
- Lay the groundwork for background job processing and pipeline integration

### Why REST Ingestion?
- Enables remote and automated data submission for CI/CD pipelines and external integrations.
- Provides real-time ingestion capabilities and fine-grained error feedback compared to batch CLI workflows.

### Pipeline Integration Strategy
The REST API integrates with the existing glyphsieve pipeline through:
- **Background Job Processing:** Raw CSV uploads trigger normalization as background jobs
- **Internal API Bridge:** The glyphsieve CLI exposes internal entrypoints callable via asyncio coroutine or subprocess bridge
- **Dual Processing Paths:** 
  - Raw data → Pipeline processing → Scored output → Persistence
  - Pre-scored data → Direct validation → Persistence
- **Job Status Tracking:** Background processing with status endpoints and progress monitoring

### In-Scope
This Epic covers:
- Endpoint definitions and validation for import
- Upload of structured CSV artifacts via form-data or JSON body
- Metadata generation and tracking (import_id, import_index, timestamp)
- Import summary generation and error response design
- Integration with persistence layer (SQLite engine)
- Associated tests (engine-level, route-level, and integration)

### Out-of-Scope
- Direct ingestion from external web URLs (scraping/importing from the web)
- Authorization or multi-tenant permissioning
- Streaming ingestion or WebSocket interfaces.

### Tasks
**Implementation Order (Updated based on strategic direction):**

**Phase 1 - Foundation (Easy Wins):**
1. `TASK.ingest.02.api.import-from-pipeline-output`: Import enriched CSV from glyphsieve pipeline output (easy win, already matches schema).
2. `TASK.ingest.04.api.import-response-format`: Standardize import response format and error reporting.
3. `TASK.ingest.06.api.error-handling-enhancement`: Enhance row-level error reporting and validation feedback.

**Phase 2 - Core Functionality:**
4. `TASK.ingest.01.api.import-csv`: Implement raw CSV upload endpoint with pipeline processing.
5. `TASK.ingest.07.api.pipeline-integration`: Integrate with glyphsieve normalization and scoring pipeline.
6. `TASK.ingest.03.api.upload-and-validate-artifacts`: File upload and schema validation with save_to_disk option.

**Phase 3 - Enhancement:**
7. `TASK.ingest.08.api.schema-alignment`: Add import_index field to ScoredListing table.
8. `TASK.ingest.05.api.schema-versioning-support`: Add API schema versioning for backward compatibility.

### Constraints
- Must conform to DTO and SQLite schema already defined
- Must provide a unique `import_id` (UUID) per ingest session
- Rows must include an `import_index` (ordinal within import)
- All responses must return a clear summary (count, errors, import_id)

### Success Criteria
- Clients can submit JSON or CSV-formatted scored listings to `glyphd` REST endpoints.
- The service validates payloads, annotates metadata, and persists all records reliably.
- Operators can query ingestion results by `import_id` to retrieve counts and error details.
- All new routes and logic are covered by automated tests and pass lint checks.

## ✅ Epic Completed

**Date Completed:** 2025-08-01

**Summary of Achievements:**
- ✅ **Dual-Path Ingestion System:** Successfully implemented both raw CSV ingestion (with pipeline processing) and pre-scored data ingestion
- ✅ **Complete Pipeline Integration:** Raw CSV uploads automatically trigger normalization → enrichment → scoring via glyphsieve pipeline
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Reporting:** Comprehensive row-level error tracking with `RowErrorDTO`, `ImportSummaryStatsDTO`, and detailed validation feedback
- ✅ **Schema Versioning:** Full API versioning support with `SchemaVersion` enum and version-aware endpoints
- ✅ **Artifact Validation:** Pre-ingestion validation endpoint with optional disk saving for debugging
- ✅ **Database Schema Alignment:** Added `import_index` field to align database with DTO models
- ✅ **Standardized Response Format:** Consistent `ImportResultDTO` across all ingestion endpoints
- ✅ **Production-Ready Quality:** All 52 tests passing, comprehensive linting, full integration testing

**Key Endpoints Delivered:**
- `POST /api/import/csv` - Raw CSV upload with pipeline processing
- `POST /api/imports/from-pipeline` - Pre-scored CSV import
- `POST /api/ingest/upload-artifact` - File validation without persistence
- `GET /api/schema/versions` - Schema version information
- `GET /api/schema/versions/{version}` - Version support checking
