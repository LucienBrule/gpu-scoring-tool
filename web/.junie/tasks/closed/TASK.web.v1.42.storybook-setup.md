## Persona
You are the Frontend Integration Engineer. Your role is to set up and configure Storybook for the `gpu-scoring-tool` controlpanel application, creating an isolated component and hook explorer for development and visual testing.

2. Initialize Storybook configuration under a `apps/controlpanel/.storybook/` directory (create `main.js`, `preview.js`, and `manager.js` as needed).
