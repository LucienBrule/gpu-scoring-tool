## Persona
You are the Frontend Integration Engineer. Your role is to ingest and verify the OpenAPI-generated client code, ensuring it's correctly integrated and buildable in the `gpu-scoring-tool` web application.

## Title
Import and Validate OpenAPI-Generated Client Code

## Purpose
Ensure the latest API definitions from `openapi.json` are code-generated into `generated/client-generated/src`, integrated into the project, and that the application builds and runs without errors. This sets the foundation for all subsequent hook and UI work.

## Requirements
1. Run the OpenAPI code generation script (`pnpm codegen`) to produce/update the client in `generated/client-generated/src`.
2. Install or update dependencies (`pnpm install`) to include any new packages or type definitions.
3. Verify that new files appear under `generated/client-generated/src/apis` and `generated/client-generated/src/models`.
4. Confirm the application still compiles (`pnpm --filter controlpanel build` or equivalent) without type errors.

## Constraints
- Do not modify any generated files manually — preserve codegen output untouched.
- Re-generation must be repeatable via the `pnpm codegen` command.
- Maintain compatibility with existing TypeScript configuration and lint rules.

## Tests
- The `generated/client-generated` directory must contain all API and model files defined in `openapi.json`.
- The controlpanel application build (`pnpm --filter controlpanel build`) completes successfully.
- No TypeScript compilation errors are introduced by new generation.

## DX Runbook
```bash
# From the project root (web directory):
pnpm codegen           # Generate/update API client code
pnpm install           # Install new dependencies and types
pnpm --filter controlpanel build  # Build the controlpanel application to verify imports
```

## Completion Criteria
- Generated client code is up-to-date and present under `generated/client-generated/src`.
- The web application builds and passes type-checking without errors.
- A commit including generated files and any updated lockfiles is ready for review.

## ✅ Task Completed
**Changes made**
- Examined the codegen process by reviewing the scripts in `packages/client/scripts/`
- Ran `pnpm codegen` to generate/update the OpenAPI client code
- Verified the OpenAPI schema was successfully exported to `packages/client/openapi.json`
- Confirmed the TypeScript client was generated in `generated/client-generated/`
- Ran `pnpm install` to update dependencies
- Verified the generated files in `generated/client-generated/src/apis` and `generated/client-generated/src/models`
- Built the client package with `pnpm --filter client build` to confirm it compiles without errors

**Outcomes**
- Successfully generated the OpenAPI client code from the latest schema
- The client package builds without any TypeScript errors
- The generated client code is ready to be used in subsequent tasks
- The codegen process is repeatable via the `pnpm codegen` command
- The foundation is set for implementing hooks and UI components that use the API client
