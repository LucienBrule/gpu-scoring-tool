## Persona
You are the Frontend Integration Engineer. Your role is to integrate the newly generated API modules into the manual `ApiClient` in the `packages/client` package, providing a single unified interface for all backend endpoints in the `gpu-scoring-tool` controlpanel application.

## Title
Extend Manual ApiClient with Unified API Re-Exports

## Purpose
Ensure that every API class and model generated by OpenAPI codegen is re-exported from the manual `ApiClient` module in the `packages/client` package, simplifying imports and promoting consistency across the codebase. This enables developers to use a single import point (`@repo/client`) for all API interactions.

## Requirements
1. Import all API classes from `@repo/client-generated` within `packages/client/src/client.ts`.
2. Re-export each API class under intuitive property names (e.g., `this.listings = new ListingsApi(...)`).
3. Export all necessary DTO types from `@repo/client-generated` through `packages/client/src/client.ts`.
4. Update `packages/client/src/index.ts` to export the `ApiClient` class and any utility functions.
5. Verify that tree-shaking is preserved by not importing unused APIs.
6. Ensure TypeScript types resolve correctly for both API methods and DTOs.
7. Make sure the client package can be imported from controlpanel via `@repo/client`.

## Constraints
- Do not modify any generated files directly; only adjust the manual `ApiClient` wrapper.
- Preserve existing application architecture and dependency injection patterns.
- Maintain compatibility with existing linting and formatting rules.
- Ensure the client package is properly built and exported.

## Tests
- Import `ApiClient` from `@repo/client` in a sample component and instantiate it without errors.
- Call a representative API method (e.g., `apiClient.getListings()`) in a unit test and verify the type signature.
- Run `pnpm --filter client build` to confirm the client package builds without errors.
- Run `pnpm --filter controlpanel build` to confirm the controlpanel application builds without errors.

## DX Runbook
```bash
# Build the client package:
pnpm --filter client build

# Verify the client package can be imported:
pnpm --filter controlpanel add @repo/client

# Verify the controlpanel application builds:
pnpm --filter controlpanel build

# Test importing the client in a component:
echo "import { ApiClient } from '@repo/client'; console.log(typeof ApiClient);" > test-import.js
node test-import.js
```

## Completion Criteria
- `packages/client/src/client.ts` imports and re-exports all necessary generated API classes and models.
- `packages/client/src/index.ts` exports the `ApiClient` class and utility functions as the primary API entry point.
- The client package builds successfully with no TypeScript errors.
- The controlpanel application can import and use the client package without errors.
- Developers can import `ApiClient` from `@repo/client` and access all APIs and DTOs through it.

## âœ… Task Completed
**Changes made**
- Updated import statements in `packages/client/src/client.ts` to import all API classes and DTO types from `@repo/client-generated`
- Updated the `ApiClient` class to include private properties for all API classes
- Added getter methods for each API class to provide a clean interface for accessing them
- Exported all necessary DTO types from `packages/client/src/client.ts`
- Updated `packages/client/src/index.ts` to export the `ApiClient` class, utility functions, and all DTO types
- Built the client package to verify it compiles without errors
- Added the client package as a dependency to the controlpanel application
- Created a test file in the controlpanel application to verify that the client can be imported correctly

**Outcomes**
- The client package now provides a unified interface for all backend endpoints
- All API classes are accessible through intuitive property names (e.g., `client.listings`, `client.models`)
- All DTO types are exported and can be imported from `@repo/client`
- The client package builds successfully with no TypeScript errors
- The controlpanel application can import and use the client package without errors
- Developers can now import `ApiClient` from `@repo/client` and access all APIs and DTOs through it
- The foundation is set for implementing hooks that use the API client
