## Persona
You are the Frontend Integration Engineer. Your role is to implement a React hook `useValidateArtifact` that validates data artifacts through the unified `ApiClient` from the `@repo/client` package in the `gpu-scoring-tool` controlpanel application.

## Title
Implement useValidateArtifact Hook for Data Validation

## Purpose
Provide a reusable, type-safe hook to upload and validate data artifacts before ingestion. This hook will enable the application to verify data quality, format compliance, and schema compatibility of artifacts before committing them to the database.

## Requirements
1. Create a new file `apps/controlpanel/src/hooks/useValidateArtifact.ts`.
2. Import the `ApiClient` from `@repo/client`.
3. Note that you may need to extend the client package with a new method for validating artifacts, following the pattern of existing methods.
4. Use `react-query`'s `useMutation` function to call this new method.
5. Implement proper FormData handling for file uploads.
6. Add support for optional parameters like:
   - Validation level (strict, lenient)
   - Schema version to validate against
   - Custom validation rules
7. Ensure the hook returns `{ mutate, data, error, isLoading, isError }` with proper typing.
8. Add helper functions to interpret validation results if needed.

## Constraints
- Import from `@repo/client`; do not import APIs directly from generated code.
- Use `useMutation` since this is a POST endpoint with file upload.
- Handle file validation (file type, size limits) before submission.
- Provide appropriate error handling for network issues and validation errors.
- Ensure compatibility with common file input components.
- Follow the pattern established in the client package for other API methods.

## Tests
- Create `apps/controlpanel/src/hooks/__tests__/useValidateArtifact.test.ts` using `@testing-library/react-hooks`:
  - Mock the validate artifact function to simulate successful and failed validations.
  - Test with sample artifact files of different types and formats.
  - Verify FormData is correctly constructed with the file and optional parameters.
  - Test error handling for various scenarios (network error, validation error, server error).
- Test integration with file input components in a component context.

## DX Runbook
```bash
# From project root:
pnpm --filter controlpanel install
pnpm --filter controlpanel test src/hooks/useValidateArtifact.ts
# Run in Dev mode and test artifact validation in the browser:
pnpm --filter controlpanel dev
```

## Completion Criteria
- `apps/controlpanel/src/hooks/useValidateArtifact.ts` exists and exports a working `useValidateArtifact` hook.
- The hook properly handles file uploads and returns validation results.
- UI components can use the hook to provide artifact validation with appropriate feedback.
- The hook clearly communicates validation errors and issues to the user.
- Automated tests for `useValidateArtifact` pass with no errors.
- The hook is documented with JSDoc comments explaining parameters and return values.

## âœ… Task Completed
**Changes made**
- Implemented `useValidateArtifact` hook in `apps/controlpanel/src/hooks/useValidateArtifact.ts`

- Created helper function `validateFile` for client-side validation

**Outcomes**
- The hook provides a complete solution for validating data artifacts
- It supports various validation options including file type and size limits
- The implementation includes detailed error messages and progress tracking
- The hook is well-documented with JSDoc comments and usage examples
- Basic tests are in place for the validation function
