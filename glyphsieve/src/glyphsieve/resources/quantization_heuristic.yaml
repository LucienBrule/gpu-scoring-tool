# Quantization Heuristic Configuration
#
# This file contains the configuration for the quantization capability heuristic.
# It defines the thresholds for classifying a GPU as quantization-capable.

# Minimum VRAM capacity in GB
min_vram_gb: 24

# Maximum Thermal Design Power in watts
max_tdp_watts: 300

# Minimum MIG support level (0=none, 1-7=supported)
min_mig_support: 1
